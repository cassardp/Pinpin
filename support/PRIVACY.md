# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2025

Pinpin is built with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Our Commitment

**We do not collect, store, or have access to your personal data.**

Pinpin is a local-first application. Your content stays on your devices and in your private iCloud account.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
All your saved content (images, links, text, categories) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.

### iCloud Sync
If enabled, your data syncs across your Apple devices via your private iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit. This data is:
- Encrypted in transit and at rest
- Stored in your personal iCloud container
- Never accessible to us

## Third-Party Services

### Visual Search (Google Lens)
When you use the "Find Similar" feature:
- The selected image is temporarily uploaded to enable the Google Lens search
- This is the only time image data leaves your device
- No data is retained after the search completes
- This feature is entirely optional

### OCR Text Extraction
Text recognition is performed **entirely on your device** using Apple's Vision framework. No images are sent to external servers.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information
- Usage analytics
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Browsing history
- Any form of tracking

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share any user data. We don't have access to it in the first place.

## Children's Privacy

Pinpin does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since we collect no data at all, this is inherently satisfied.

## Your Rights

Since your data is stored locally and in your private iCloud:
- **Access:** View all your data directly in the app
- **Delete:** Remove any item or category at any time
- **Export:** Share items using iOS standard sharing
- **Full Control:** Delete the app to remove all local data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.
