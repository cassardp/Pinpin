### Where is my data stored?

Pinpin is **local-first**. Your content is stored directly on your device and optionally synced via your private iCloud account. We never have access to your data.

### How does iCloud sync work?

If you're signed into iCloud on your devices, Pinpin automatically syncs your collection across all your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac). No setup required.

### Can I use Pinpin offline?

Yes! Pinpin works fully offline. Your content is stored locally and syncs when you're back online.

### How does Visual Search work?

Pinpin uses Google Lens to find similar images online. When you use this feature, the image is temporarily uploaded to perform the search. No data is retained after the search.

### How does OCR text extraction work?

Text extraction is performed **entirely on your device** using Apple's Vision framework. No images are sent to external servers for OCR.

### How do I delete my data?

You can delete individual items or entire categories directly in the app. To remove all data, simply delete the app from your device.
